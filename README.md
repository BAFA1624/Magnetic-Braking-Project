This is a central place to keep all files related to the project.

Here's a video which does a super simple rundown on how to use github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo

It mostly relates to code/software development, however the principles are the same for storing any type of file or project. In our case, the version control systems and ability to commit changes bit by bit allows you to safely manage a group project. When someone makes a commit, we are able to see what has been changed and compare between versions, make comments and rollback changes if we decide to take a different path.

Once you have github accounts, I'll give everyone both read & write permissions. To give people the chance to talk with their collaborators when you commit an update to part of the project, try to follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li>If a separate topic branch doesn't already exist, create a new branch with a short but informative name relating to the part of the project you're working on.</li>
  <li>Switch to that branch.</li>
  <li>Commit & push your changes to that branch.</li>
  <li>Create a pull request to merge that branch with the "main" branch.</li>
  <li>Discuss the changes with the other person working on that part of the project.</li>
  <li>Make any additional changes to the branch till you're happy that it's ready to be committed.</li>
  <li>Merge the pull request with the "main" branch.</li>
</ol>
